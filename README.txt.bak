Liaison Site Prober helps you log and track key changes and user actions on your WordPress website — giving you better visibility and security.

== Description ==

<strong>A lightweight and easy-to-use plugin to secure and monitor your WordPress website.</strong><br>

Have you ever wondered when your website changed — and who did it?  
Liaison Site Prober makes it easy to track your WordPress site's change history and user activities.

With Liaison Site Prober, you can easily monitor:

* Who logged in, logged out, or attempted (and failed) to log in.  
* When a post was published or updated — and by whom.  
* When a plugin or theme was activated, deactivated, or modified.  

<strong>Export to CSV</strong> — Quickly export your website’s activity log for auditing or backup purposes.

The plugin tracks:

* <strong>Posts</strong> – Created, updated, deleted  
* <strong>Categories</strong> – Created, updated, deleted  
* <strong>Taxonomies</strong> – Created, updated, deleted  
* <strong>Comments</strong> – Created, approved, unapproved, trashed, untrashed, spammed, unspammed, deleted  
* <strong>Users</strong> – Login, logout, failed login, profile updated, registered, deleted  
* <strong>Plugins</strong> – Installed, updated, activated, deactivated, modified  
* <strong>Themes</strong> – Installed, updated, deleted, activated, modified (via Editor or Customizer)

<h3>Data Storage Isolation</h3>

To keep your WordPress database clean and easy to back up,  
all log data is stored in a dedicated custom table, fully isolated from your site’s core content.
